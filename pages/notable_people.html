              Nicolaus August Otto was a German engineer who successfully
              developed the compressed charge internal combustion engine which
              ran on petroleum gas and led to the modern internal combustion
              engine. The Association of German Engineers (VDI) created DIN
              standard 1940 which says "Otto Engine: internal combustion engine
              in which the ignition of the compressed fuel-air mixture is
              initiated by a timed spark", which has been applied to all engines
              of this type since.

              Wilhelm Maybach was an early German engine designer and
              industrialist. During the 1890s he was hailed in France, then the
              world centre for car production, as the "King of Designers". From
              the late 19th century Wilhelm Maybach, together with Gottlieb
              Daimler, developed light, high-speed internal combustion engines
              suitable for land, water, and air use. These were fitted to the
              world's first motorcycle, motorboat, and after Daimler's death, a
              new automobile introduced in late 1902, the Mercedes model, built
              to the specifications of Emil Jellinek.

              Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel was a German inventor and mechanical
              engineer who is famous for having invented the Diesel engine,
              which burns Diesel fuel; both are named after him. Diesel engines
              have the benefit of running more fuel-efficiently than any other
              internal combustion engines suited for motor vehicles, allowing
              more heat to be converted to mechanical work. After Diesel's
              death, his engine underwent much development and became a very
              important replacement for the steam piston engine in many
              applications.

              Karl Friedrich Benz was a German engine designer and automotive
              engineer. His Benz Patent Motorcar from 1885 is considered the
              first practical modern automobile and first car put into series
              production. He received a patent for the motorcar in 1886, the
              same year he first publicly drove the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. His
              company Benz & Cie., based in Mannheim, was the world's first
              automobile plant and largest of its day. In 1926, it merged with
              Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler-Benz, which produces
              the Mercedes-Benz among other brands. Benz is widely regarded as
              "the father of the car", as well as the "father of the automobile
              industry".

              Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot was a French mechanical engineer in
              the French Army, military scientist and physicist, often described
              as the "father of thermodynamics". He published only one book, the
              Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire (Paris, 1824), in which he
              expressed the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of
              heat engines and laid the foundations of the new discipline:
              thermodynamics.

              Gottlieb Daimler was a German engineer, industrial designer and
              industrialist born in Schorndorf (Kingdom of Württemberg, a
              federal state of the German Confederation), in what is now
              Germany. He was a pioneer of internal-combustion engines and
              automobile development. He invented the high-speed liquid
              petroleum-fueled engine. In 1883, together with Wilhelm Maybach,
              designed a horizontal cylinder layout compressed charge liquid
              petroleum engine that fulfilled Daimler's desire for a high speed
              engine which could be throttled, making it useful in
              transportation applications. This engine was called Daimler's
              Dream.
