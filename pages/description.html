              Internal combustion engines require precise air-fuel ratios,
              controlled ignition timing, and proper cooling for efficient
              operation. Compression ratios, exhaust systems, and lubrication
              are crucial. Throttle and governor systems regulate power and
              speed. Fuel quality matters. Regular maintenance, including oil
              changes, ensures longevity and optimal performance.

            <p>
              In petrol or diesel engines each vertical movement of the piston
              either upwards or downwards is called a stroke. Hence in
              four-stroke engines, the piston does 4 total upward and downward
              movements in total which are usually divided into four different
              stages to complete an engine cycle.

      <section class="flexbox_c centered">
        <div class="rule1">
          <h4>Intake</h4>
          <p class="margines">
            The first stroke of a petrol engine is the intake stroke. During
            this stroke, the piston travels down the cylinder from the upper
            maximum position to the lower minimum position. At the same time,
            premixed air and fuel are suctioned into the cylinder via the open
            inlet valves, increasing the volume inside the cylinder and keeping
            the pressure in the cylinder below atmospheric pressure. The fuel is
            pre-mixed with air before it reaches the inlet valve, usually with a
            device called a carburetor. However, more recently, an electronic
            control unit (ECU) is used to carefully evaluate the quantity of
            fuel injected in the air inlet port just above the inlet valves.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule1">
          <h4>Compression</h4>
          <p class="margines">
            After the intake stroke, the valves are closed, and the piston moves
            upward from the minimum vertical position to the maximum position,
            decreasing the volume and increasing the pressure inside the
            cylinder. The mixture is compressed towards a spark plug, and work
            is done on the air during compression. This is the second stroke. To
            ensure maximum efficiency, it's important that the spark occurs
            right before the end of the stroke. This timing allows the mixture
            to reach the top of its stroke, allowing maximum pressure to operate
            on the descending piston. The heated fuel powers the turbine, and
            then it is injected into the combustion chamber, where it is burned
            to produce energy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule1">
          <h4>Combustion</h4>
          <p class="margines">
            As the piston nears the top maximum position towards the end of the
            second stroke, the pressure in the cylinder is at its highest. The
            high pressure and temperature cause the fuel mixture to ignite when
            a spark from the spark plug is introduced. During this stage, the
            volume inside the cylinder remains almost constant. The high
            pressure from the expanded gases forces the piston to move
            downwards. Work is done by the expanding gases. The exhaust valve
            opens at the minimum position, and the pressure reduces to nearly
            atmospheric. This is the third stroke.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule1">
          <h4>Exhaust</h4>
          <p class="margines">
            After the combustion stage, the piston moves upwards, expelling the
            burnt gases through the open exhaust valve. During this fourth and
            final stroke, the pressure in the cylinder drops to just above
            atmospheric pressure. The process you've described is known as the
            Otto cycle, which is the basic operating cycle for most modern car
            engines. The cycle involves adding and rejecting energy in the form
            of heat during the combustion and exhaust stages, while work is done
            by the compression and expansion stages. This cycle is repeated over
            and over again to power the engine and keep the vehicle moving.
